				<h1 style="text-align:center;color:red">Bindhu</h1>
				<h1 style ="text-align:right"> <a href="#Top">Top</a></h1>  	   
		   	  	
		   	  	<p style="font-size:28">I am Bindhu. I am presently from Bangalore. I completed my studies in Palamaner,Sri Padmavathi WOmen's degree college.</p>
		   	  	<p style="font-size:28">My hobbies are cooking , listening to music and dancing. When I am very happy I like to dance. And now Presently I am completing my studies in   programming.Then have a goal to help the other girls who are facing issues like me. S0 after getting my job it is my first goal to support the girls.</p>
		   	 	<p style="font-size:28"> Then coming to my family background. I have a sister,and two cousin brothers. My sister's name is SINDHU, and my brother's names are Nani, MOKSHITH.
			  	He is a very naughty boy in our family. My sister and brother Mokshith are very naughty and they are very happy.And then we will play all the games at the top of the house.</p> 
			  
			  
			   	<h1 >I love Nature</h1>
			 	
			 	<p style="font-size:28">If there were no nature, we wouldn’t be alive. Humankind is dependent on nature. We get oxygen to breathe from plants and trees. 
			 	Thus, our respiratory system is regulated by nature. Not only this, nature has some magical healing powers which help patients suffering 
			 	from various diseases to recover faster. Every minute spent in the lap of nature gives a refreshing and rejuvenating feeling. It lowers the
			  	cortisol, commonly known as the stress hormone. Even placing some nice plants around the work window will lead to lower stress. Nature enhances 
			  	our brain’s activity and makes us concentrate better and be more focused. This makes our brains more creative and imaginative. Spending time in 
			  	nature will provide a healthier and longer life.</p>
			  
			  	<h1 >MY Favourite Food </H1>
			  	
			  	<p style="font-size:28">When I was a child, if you asked me whether I wanted chapathi or poori, I will say in a blink “poori”, as it has a great taste, and taste was the 
			  	biggest priority at that time. Now I would say “chapathi”. When you are young you don’t care about calories, carbohydrates, cholesterol etc. These are
			  	haunting only when you are grown up. As a child, poori was a favorite dish whenever I went to a restaurant mostly I would order poori.</p>
